# MUH Ilmava

MUH Ilmava Arduino temperature sensing hacks.


Sensor placing
============
Temperature sensors labeled as R1, R2, R3, R4 are placed in following way.  
`R1` - Incoming outside air.  
`R2` - Outgoing air to rooms.  
`R3` - Returning air from rooms.  
`R4` - After heating coil (used to heat air to avoid heat recovery cell to freeze).
